# ðŸ’« About Me:
I'm Mingus, a 19-year-old full-stack developer studying at the Bit Academy. I have a passion for building things and constantly learning new technologies.<br><br>I've been studying software development at the Bit Academy and currently am in my second year. I've honed my skills in a variety of programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, and HTML/CSS. I also have experience with various frameworks and libraries, such as Node.js and CSS frameworks such as Tailwind & Bulmma.<br><br>In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with different technologies and building personal projects. I believe that the best way to learn is by doing, so I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to improve my skills.<br><br>If you're interested in collaborating or have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out! I'd love to connect and chat about technology and development.
